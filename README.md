A small game that tells the incredible story of **Barry**, a ~~slightly~~ overweight man who should perhaps include some vegetables in his diet.

However, even though steel and rocks are not very appealing as snacks, our hero would much rather munch the chassis of a Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopter than a carrot, which in fact will lead him to some definitely astonishing events throughout the plot.

This game was developed for the [GMTK game jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024) in a total of 96 hours, so consider supporting it with a positive review and sharing it, it would make our day!
